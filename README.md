# TicTacToe
A simple TicTacToe game built for terminals.

A simple Tic Tac Toe game I build for the command line. It currently supports 1-player, 2-player, and 0-player interactions, with 0 being able to simulate the 2 AIs of the user's choosing to play against each other through simulation or watching the games, which outputs the board after each move.
